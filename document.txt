Intuition
if majority element count is more than half of length of array it will be majority element

Approach
consider 1st element is majority element and then traverse through array make count 1
if you get majority element increase count else decrease count
if count is zero make current element as majority element make count 1 and continue
after exhosted array return majority element

Complexity
Time complexity:O(N)
Space complexity:O(1)
